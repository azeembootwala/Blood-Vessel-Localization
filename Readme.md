## Blood vessel localization using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

The script CNN_vessel is the main script where the neural network is designed in a class based format.It will train your model , test it and also save the model in the results folder. 

The script us_datagenerator loads the date from the disk, preprocesses it and sends it to the CNN_vessel in batches. 

The script utilities, has  nothing but small functions needeed to run the main script file CNN_vessel.

The script scroll , just scrolls the images in the results folder and runs a slide show for presentations. So nothing important there. 

The scripts cnn_exp is just another iteration of the mail file , where I implemented batch normalization and dropout. You can skip that if you want as the results were not upto the mark after applying batch norm. 


For any other information please be rest assured that you can ask me anytime for help.
